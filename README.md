## What is Alien Invasion?

Alien Invasion is a project from the Python Crash Course book. It is my first python project. It is a simple version of the game Space Invaders, but this one is called Alien Invasion. A lot of it has been made using the tutorials from the book. But I have added some of my own features such as sounds, fonts, images and the star effect. It is an ongoing project, I will continue to add features, maybe some power ups or something like that. It is a small fun game that tracks the high score. You get 3 lives, every time you clear the screen, you move up a level and everything intensifies. Can you beat the high score?

## Running the game

Right now it requires pygame and python to run it. Im working on making it more accessible. If you clone the repository and have python and pygame installed, then just run the `alien_invasion.py` file to launch the game.
