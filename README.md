This is a project from the Python Crash Course book. It is my first python project. It is a simple version of the game Space Invaders, but this one is called Alien Invasion. A lot of it has been made using the tutorials from the book. But I have added some of my own features such as sounds, fonts, images and the star effect. It is an ongoing project, I will continue to add features, maybe some power ups or something like that. It is a small fun game that tracks the high score. You get 3 lives, everytime you clear the screen, you move up a level and everything intensifies. Can you beat the high score?

Right now it requires pygame and python to run it. Im working on making it more accessible
